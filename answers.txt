RCES Assignment 1

1) Number of earthquakes: cat signif.txt.tsv | wc -l
5959 so I think there are 5958 earthquakes because the first row looks like column names
2) Number of columns: head -1 signif.txt.tsv | tr '|' ' ' | wc -w
47 
3) Cut and create new file 
YEAR is the 3rd column
EQ_PRIMARY is the 10th column
COUNTRY is the 18th column
cut -f 3,10,18 signif.txt.tsv >> Year_Mag_Country.tsv
4) Top 10 highest magnitude earthquakes
sort -k 2 Year_Mag_Country.tsv
1965	 8.7	USA
2010	 8.8	CHILE
1716	 8.8	PERU
1812	 8.8	USA
1952	 9.0	RUSSIA
1700	 9.0	USA
2004	 9.1	INDONESIA
2011	 9.1	JAPAN
1964	 9.2	USA
1960	 9.5	CHILE
5) How many unique countries are listed in the database? Use cut,sort,uniq, wc and a few pipes | to form a single expression that answers this question.
cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq | wc 
Prints:     154     213    1606 This means there are 154 unique countries in the database
6) Use the grep command to count how many earthquakes in the database are located in the USA or USA TERRITORY
grep -c  USA Year_Mag_Country.tsv
294
7) Modified to just USA 
grep -v -c  USA Year_Mag_Country.tsv          
5665
grep -v -c  "USA TERRITORY" Year_Mag_Country.tsv
5920
5920 - 5665 = 255 
8) cut -f 3 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr -k1,1 | head -n 10
 579 CHINA
 400 JAPAN
 365 IRAN
 363 INDONESIA
 324 ITALY
 319 TURKEY
 259 GREECE
 255 USA
 207 PHILIPPINES
 193 MEXICO
9) I did this first with the $1 argument. That script is:
#!/bin/bash

count=$(grep -i -c "$1" Year_Mag_Country.tsv)

echo "Earthquakes in $1: $count"

# You call it like this:
bash countEq.sh USA
Earthquakes in USA: 294

I wanted to create a more interactive script that you can enter a country (case insensitive) and it will tell you the count. If the country doesn't exist, it will just return 0.

touch countEq.sh 

## Here's an example
#!/bin/bash

echo "Please enter a country: "
read country

count=$(grep -i -c "$country" Year_Mag_Country.tsv)

echo "Earthquakes in $country: $count"

Please enter a country: 
CHina
Earthquakes in CHina: 579

10) Following the original instructions to use $1 for this one:

#!/bin/bash

count=$(grep -i -c "$1" Year_Mag_Country.tsv)
largest=$(grep -i "$1" Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort -nr -k2,2 | head -n 1)

echo "Earthquakes in $1: $count"
echo "Largest earthquake in $1: $largest"

bash countEq_getLargestEq.sh CHILE
Earthquakes in CHILE: 192
Largest earthquake in CHILE: 1960	 9.5	CHILE 

11) Top 10 years by number of earthquakes
cut -f 1 Year_Mag_Country.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10
  78 2004
  77 2008
  72 2003
  67 2007
  62 2010
  61 2006
  60 2009
  60 2005
  60 2002
  59 2011
